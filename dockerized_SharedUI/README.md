# SharedUI
SharedUI is written in bash, Power Shell in windows is not able to execute this program. So we used docker to execute this code.
Original code is [here](https://github.com/IncandelaLab/SharedUI).

# how do use it
* Open Docker Desktop
* Load VcXsrv configurations
* Overwrite filemanager_data from [other source](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Geyf9KwpQOncLSZAvq2nZIrNbzvG-S12?usp=drive_link).
* Double click "init.bat"
* Double click "run.bat"


# Note
The result would be recorded into *filmanager_data* with json format. You can back up or access for other purpose. All input values are recorded into *filemanager_data* simultaneously.
